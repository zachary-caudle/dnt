# URL Parameters

The URL parameters are:
letters (The letters that go into the textbox) https://zachary-caudle.github.io/dnt?letters=

separator (What separates the letters from the rest of the string) https://zachary-caudle.github.io/dnt?separator=

prefix (Anything before the string) https://zachary-caudle.github.io/dnt?prefix=

suffix (Anything after the string) https://zachary-caudle.github.io/dnt?suffix=

To combine multiple parameters, add an "&" symbol followed by the parameter, for example if I want the letters to be ZC and the separator to be "@", the URL would look like:
https://zachary-caudle.github.io/dnt/?letters=zc&separator=@
